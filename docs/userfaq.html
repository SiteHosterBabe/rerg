<p>No. We are a diverse group of volunteers from around the world who work on this
project in their spare time. Code-wise most of project contributions come from
Europe where the current <span class="caps">GIMP</span> maintainers live. Our translators are an even
more diverse group of contributors, since <span class="caps">GIMP</span> is available in
80&nbsp;languages/locales.</p>

<p>Yes, you can. <span class="caps">GIMP</span> is free software, it doesn&#8217;t put restrictions on the kind
of work you produce with&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-gimps-license-and-how-do-i-comply-with-it">What&#8217;s the <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s license, and how do I comply with it?<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-the-gimps-license-and-how-do-i-comply-with-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><span class="caps">GIMP</span> is distributed under terms of General Public License v3 and later. In a
nutshell, this&nbsp;means:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are free to use <span class="caps">GIMP</span>, for any&nbsp;purpose</li>
<li>You are free to distribute <span class="caps">GIMP</span></li>
<li>You can study how <span class="caps">GIMP</span> works and change&nbsp;it</li>
<li>You can distribute changed versions of <span class="caps">GIMP</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that once you distribute modified version of <span class="caps">GIMP</span>, you also must publish

<p>Yes, under terms of the General Public License this is perfectly legal,
provided that the seller also gave you the source code of <span class="caps">GIMP</span> and any
modifications he/she introduced. Please see
<a href="../about/selling.html">this page</a> for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<h3 id="are-you-trying-to-develop-a-photoshop-killer-app">Are you trying to develop a Photoshop killer app?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-you-trying-to-develop-a-photoshop-killer-app" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>No. Most generic image editors look like Photoshop simply because Adobe&#8217;s
application was among the first image editors as we know them now, so
developers tend to stick to what people know&nbsp;&mdash; in general&nbsp;terms.</p>
<p>What we aim to do is to create a high-end image manipulation application that
is free to use and modify by everyone,&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, the proposed &#8220;high-end&#8221; status does automatically put <span class="caps">GIMP</span> into
direct comparison against Photoshop, but we don&#8217;t think about competition
much. We have too many ideas of our own to implement, and too many things to
improve before the notion of competition begins to make the slightest&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>We do, however, acknowledge the fact that people will treat <span class="caps">GIMP</span> as Photoshop
replacement no matter what we tell them, and that&#8217;s all right with us. You
own this software, it&#8217;s up to you to decide how you make use of&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-like-gimps-user-interface-why-cant-you-just-copy-adobe-photoshop">I don&#8217;t like <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s user interface. Why can&#8217;t you just copy Adobe Photoshop?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-dont-like-gimps-user-interface-why-cant-you-just-copy-adobe-photoshop" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the development in the project was somewhat erratic with regards
to taking usability into consideration, which is rather typical for free
software projects, but inexcusable for a high-end image editor that <span class="caps">GIMP</span> aims to&nbsp;become.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2013, we worked with Peter Sikking of Man+Machine Works, a
professional usability architect, who helped us shape the project vision for
<span class="caps">GIMP</span>, interviews professional users to better understand their workflows and
demands, and wrote functional specifications for various <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&nbsp;features.</p>
<p><a href="https://gui.gimp.org/">This collaboration</a> resulted in major improvements of
<span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s usability, in particular: the rectangular-based selection/cropping
tools, the unified free/polyline selection tool, the single-window mode, the
upcoming unified transformation tool&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>While working on functional specifications, Peter researched how various
features are implemented in applications with a partially matching feature set
(such as Adobe Photoshop), but the final design was made to help actual users
complete their tasks as fast as possible. This is exactly the kind of approach
to designing interfaces that we consider to be superior to merely copying user
interaction&nbsp;decisions.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it">I don&#8217;t like the name <span class="caps">GIMP</span>. Will you change it?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>With all due respect,&nbsp;no.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been using the name <span class="caps">GIMP</span> for more than 20 years and it&#8217;s widely&nbsp;known.</p>
<p>The name was originally (and remains) an acronym; although the word &#8220;gimp&#8221; can
be used offensively in some cultures, that is not our&nbsp;intent.</p>
<p>On top of that, we feel that in the long run, sterilization of language will
do more harm than good. <span class="caps">GIMP</span> has been quite popular for a long time in search
engine results compared to the use of the word &#8220;gimp&#8221;. So we think we are on
the right track to make a positive change and make &#8220;gimp&#8221; something people
actually feel good about. Especially if we add all the features we&#8217;ve been
meaning to implement and fix the user&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>Finally, if you still have strong feelings about the name &#8220;<span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8221;, you should
feel free to promote the use of the long form <span class="caps">GNU</span> Image Manipulation Program
or exercise your software freedom to fork and rebrand <span class="caps">GIMP</span>.</p>

<p>We release both updates to the current stable version and development&nbsp;versions.</p>
<p>We cut new updates of the stable version in two cases: 1) some newly introduced
bug is knowingly affecting a lot of users; 2) the amount of improvements and
bug fixes is large enough to justify an update&nbsp;&mdash; typically, a few
dozens of each, but there is no&nbsp;rule.</p>
<p>Currently, we are working on <span class="caps">GIMP</span> 3.0 that will be using the <span class="caps">GTK</span>+3 user
interface toolkit and feature a lot of under-the-hood work. We also backport as
many changes as possible to the 2.10.x branch so that you would get them as part
of bugfix releases. We make 2.10.x releases on a regular basis, usually once
in one or two&nbsp;months.</p>

<p>We are a team of volunteers with day jobs, families, and personal interests
beyond development of software. Given that, we try to avoid the situation when
we cannot deliver a release, because something else at work/in family came&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Instead we provide a <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/roadmap">feature-based roadmap</a>
that roughly outlines, in what order we will be implementing various popular
requests made by&nbsp;users.</p>
<h3 id="arent-you-interested-in-doing-paid-development-of-gimp-via-crowdfunding">Aren&#8217;t you interested in doing paid development of <span class="caps">GIMP</span> via crowdfunding?<a class="headerlink" href="#arent-you-interested-in-doing-paid-development-of-gimp-via-crowdfunding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Some developers have jobs they love and contribute in their spare time, while
others actively try to make a living with Free Software development. <span class="caps">GIMP</span>
project actively encourages personal fundraisers by trusted contributors. There
are two such campaigns running at the moment. You can learn more about them on
the <a href="../donating/index.html">Donate</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>If you are willing to launch a campaign and develop some features for <span class="caps">GIMP</span>,
talk to us about changes you are about to propose. We&#8217;ll help you to flesh
out your idea and promote it to a larger&nbsp;community.</p>
<h3 id="will-you-release-gimp-for-android-or-ios-devices">Will you release <span class="caps">GIMP</span> for Android or iOS devices?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-you-release-gimp-for-android-or-ios-devices" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Apps for mobile devices imply a different approach to designing interfaces.
Since most of <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s source code is related to the user interface one way or
another, it means that we would have to design and then develop a whole new
application. Given the current manpower, we&#8217;d rather focus on delivering a
great image manipulation program for desktop&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>However, we are interested to consult 3rd party developers willing to make a
free/libre <span class="caps">GIMP</span>-branded image manipulation program for Android. As for iOS,
please note that <span class="caps">GIMP</span> is licensed under <span class="caps">GNU</span> <span class="caps">GPL</span> v3+ which conflicts with
Apple&#8217;s Terms of Service. For a full story, please read

<p>We switched to a dark user interface theme and a symbolic icon theme by default
in version 2.10, we also introduced tool groups. If you absolutely want to revert
<span class="caps">GIMP</span> to colorful icons, bright/system user interface, and no tool groups, here is
what you&nbsp;do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <code>Edit &gt; Preferences</code>, in the newly opened window go to <code>Interface &gt; Theme</code>
and change the theme from <em>Dark</em> to <em>System</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to the <code>Interface &gt; Icon Theme</code> page nearby and change the theme
from <em>Symbolic</em> to <em>Legacy</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, go to <code>Interface &gt; Toolbox</code> in the very same <em>Preferences</em> dialog and
tick off the <em>Use tool groups</em>&nbsp;setting.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="caps">GIMP</span> 2.10 was released in April 2018 and is the first version of the program
to feature processing with precision of 16-bit and 32-bit per color&nbsp;channel.</p>

<p>Currently the plan is to introduce non-destructive editing in <span class="caps">GIMP</span> 3.2. This
is a huge change that will require rethinking the workflow and parts of the user&nbsp;interface.</p>

<p>Starting with version 2.10, <span class="caps">GIMP</span> features plug-ins for using
<a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a> and
<a href="https://rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a> to process raw images, as well as a
preference for a default raw processing&nbsp;plug-in.</p>
<h3 id="i-do-a-lot-of-desktop-publishing-related-work-will-you-ever-support-cmyk">I do a lot of desktop publishing related work. Will you ever support <span class="caps">CMYK</span>?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-do-a-lot-of-desktop-publishing-related-work-will-you-ever-support-cmyk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Yes, better support for <span class="caps">CMYK</span> has been on our roadmap for a long time. One of the
ideas, how we want to make this work, was introduced by user interaction
architect Peter Sikking at Libre Graphics Meeting 2009 and later&nbsp;&mdash;
in his two-part article in his company&#8217;s blog:
<a href="http://blog.mmiworks.net/2009/05/gimp-enter.html">1</a>,
<a href="http://blog.mmiworks.net/2009/06/gimp-squaring-cmyk-circle.html">2</a>. Please
take some time to read up on&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>We needed to finalize transition to the new image processing engine, <span class="caps">GEGL</span>,
before attemtping to introduce features like <span class="caps">CMYK</span> support. Now that it is
complete, initial work on <span class="caps">CMYK</span> support has been done in the babl and <span class="caps">GEGL</span>
libraries that <span class="caps">GIMP</span> relies on. This is partially
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/pippin/posts">funded by the <span class="caps">GIMP</span> community</a>,
you can join in,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>More work happened in the <span class="caps">GIMP</span> 2.99.12 development iteration, as a <a href="../news/2022/06/03/cmyk-in-gsoc-2022/index.html">GSoC
project</a>. This
allowed or improved importing and exporting <span class="caps">CMYK</span> images in various file
formats (converted to and from <span class="caps">RGB</span> as storage format) and expose <span class="caps">CMYK</span>
pixel information within <span class="caps">GIMP</span> (e.g. when color picking) within the
context of a soft-proof color&nbsp;profile.</p>
<p>More work needs to be done to better expose <span class="caps">CMYK</span> in the user interface.
This should happen for <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&nbsp;3.0.</p>
<p>As for making <span class="caps">CMYK</span> a core image format (such as <span class="caps">RGB</span>, Grayscale or
indexed), we have no timeline on this but we also wish it to be possible
some day.
Also, please note that we are not planning advanced features such as <span class="caps">GCR</span> support
for now. This will most likely require a new dedicated developer in the&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>Should a new developer join the team to specifically work on
<span class="caps">CMYK</span>-related features, we will do our best to help him/her to complete this
project and get it to our users as soon as&nbsp;possible.</p>

<p>We realize that some changes are disruptive to some groups of users,
especially those who got used to <span class="caps">GIMP</span> as an image editor for doing quick fixes
to lossy files such as <span class="caps">JPEG</span>, <span class="caps">PNG</span> etc. (i.e. files that cannot store layers,
masks, custom channels,&nbsp;paths).</p>
<p>However, adding a switch for every change we make adds numerous levels of
complexity that we&#8217;d rather avoid. Additionally, it would lead to dramatically
changing the way we mean <span class="caps">GIMP</span> to work. Hence we respectfully disagree to make
extra behaviour&nbsp;switches.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you don&#8217;t wish to abandon <span class="caps">GIMP</span> completely, we recommend
having a look at the
<a href="https://www.shallowsky.com/software/gimp-save/">Saver and Save/export clean plug-ins</a>
by Akkana Peck, as well as at various <span class="caps">GIMP</span> forks on GitHub, although typically
they aren&#8217;t maintained up to date with regards to&nbsp;bugfixes.</p>

<p>A <span class="caps">GTK</span>+3 based version of <span class="caps">GIMP</span> is currently in the works and will be released
as v3.0 (see the <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/roadmap">roadmap</a> for&nbsp;reference).</p>

<p>In the Rectangular or Elliptical selection tool, click in one corner of your
square or circle, then press Shift while dragging toward the other corner. Or
enable the checkbox for Fixed: Aspect Ratio in tool options and make sure the
aspect ratio is set to 1:1 before starting your square or circular&nbsp;selection.</p>
<p>Once you have a selection, Edit-&gt;Stroke Selection&#8230; will draw a line the
shape of the selection you just&nbsp;made.</p>
<p>For curved selections, like circles, stroking with the Paintbrush paint tool
will usually give a smoother looking line. You can get an even smoother line
by converting the selection to a path (Select-&gt;To Path), then using
Edit-&gt;Stroke Path&#8230; instead of Stroke&nbsp;Selection&#8230;</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="caps">GIMP</span> does support graphic tablets and maps pressure, stroke speed, and
other events to its advanced brush engine properties. However, the version of
the user interface toolkit that  <span class="caps">GIMP</span> currently relies on (<span class="caps">GTK</span>+ 2.x) is broken
beyond repair on Windows and Mac with regards to supporting some advanced input
devices such as&nbsp;Wacom&#8217;s.</p>
<p>To fix this, we need to port <span class="caps">GIMP</span> to <span class="caps">GTK</span>+3 where everything mostly works as
expected. This is a work in&nbsp;progress.</p>
