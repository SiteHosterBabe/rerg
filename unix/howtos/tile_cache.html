<p><em><strong>Quick summary</strong> for those who do not want to read all this: if your system has good swapping behavior (like most <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux systems) and if you have enough virtual memory (swap), then set the tile cache size as high as possible. If not, then set it to about 80% of the available <span class="caps">RAM</span> on your system. If you are not satisfied with this quick advice, then keep on&nbsp;reading&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Image processing can require a lot of memory. <span class="caps">GIMP</span> uses the operating system services to handle memory, up to a given point, past which it uses its own system so it does not eat all system memory resources. This system consists in sending old data to files in the disk. The decision point is what Tile Cache determines, the limit of operating system resources to use, and is measured in Bytes (or multiples, like MegaBytes). It does not include <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s own memory, just the space required for the image&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>A low value means that <span class="caps">GIMP</span> sends data really quickly to disk, not making real use of the avaliable <span class="caps">RAM</span> and making the disks work without real reason. A too high value, and the other applications start to have less system resources forcing them to swap space, which is making the disks work too, or maybe some will even get killed or start to malfunction due lack of <span class="caps">RAM</span>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-choose-a-number-for-tile-cache">How to choose a number for Tile Cache?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-choose-a-number-for-tile-cache" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are some ways to decide what value to use as Tile Cache, as well as some&nbsp;tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget about this and hope the default works. It worked when computers had few <span class="caps">RAM</span> and people just tried to make small images with <span class="caps">GIMP</span> while running one or two applications each time. If you want something easy and only use <span class="caps">GIMP</span> to make screenshoots and some logos, probably the best&nbsp;solution.</li>
<li>Ask someone to do it for you, which in the case of a computer serving multiple users at the same time can be a good idea, that way the administrator and other users do not get mad at you for abusing the machine, nor you get a badly underperfoming <span class="caps">GIMP</span>. If it is your machine and a single user at a given time, it could mean money, or drinks, as price for the service.&nbsp;;]</li>
<li>Start changing the value a bit each time and check that it goes faster and faster with each increase, but the systems does not complain about lack of memory. Be forewarned that sometimes lack of memory ends with some applications being killed to make space for the&nbsp;others.</li>
<li>Do some simple maths and calculate a viable value. Maybe you will have to tune it later, but maybe you have to tune it anyway with the other previous methods. At least you know what is happening and can get the best from your&nbsp;computer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-number-to-use-for-tile-cache">What number to use for Tile Cache?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-number-to-use-for-tile-cache" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s guess you prefer the last option, and get a nice value to start with. First, you need to get some data about your computer. This data is the <span class="caps">RAM</span> installed, the operating system&#8217;s swap space avaliable and a general idea about the speed of the disks that store the operating system&#8217;s swap and the directory used for <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s swap. You do not need to do disk tests, nor check the <span class="caps">RPM</span> of them, the thing is to see which one seems clearly faster or slower or all similar. Remember you can change <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s swap directory in <Toolbox> -&gt; File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Folders -&gt; Swap&nbsp;Dir.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is to see how much resources you require for other apps you want to run at the same time than <span class="caps">GIMP</span>. So start all your tools and do some work with them, except <span class="caps">GIMP</span> of course, and check the usage. You can use applications like free or top, depends in what <span class="caps">OS</span> and what environment you use. The numbers you want is the memory left, including file cache. Modern <span class="caps">UNIX</span> keep a really small area free, to be able to keep big file and buffer caches. <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux&#8217;s free does the maths for you, check the column that says &#8220;free&#8221;, and the line &#8220;-/+ buffers/cache&#8221;. Note down also the free&nbsp;swap.</p>
<p>Now time for decisions and simple maths. Basically the concept is to decide if you want to base all Tile Cache in free <span class="caps">RAM</span>, or free <span class="caps">RAM</span> plus operating system free&nbsp;swap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you change applications a lot? Or keep working in <span class="caps">GIMP</span> for a long time? If you stay long times in <span class="caps">GIMP</span>, you can consider free <span class="caps">RAM</span> plus free swap as avaliable, or not, you have to check following points. If unsure about that times being long or not, check next steps too. If you are sure you switch all the apps every few time, only count free <span class="caps">RAM</span> and just go to final decision, no more things to&nbsp;check.</li>
<li>Does operating system swap live in the same physical disk than <span class="caps">GIMP</span> swap? If so, use <span class="caps">RAM</span> and swap, as this way you will try to keep disk access over a fixed, compact, area for more time. Otherwise check&nbsp;next.</li>
<li>The disk that holds the swap is faster or same speed than the disk that holds <span class="caps">GIMP</span>&#8217;s swap? If slower, take only free <span class="caps">RAM</span>, if faster or similar, use free <span class="caps">RAM</span> and swap. This way we avoid a slow disk when there is a fast one doing&nbsp;nothing.</li>
<li>You got a number, be it just the free <span class="caps">RAM</span> or the free <span class="caps">RAM</span> plus the free <span class="caps">OS</span> swap. Reduce it a bit, to be on the safe side, and that is the Tile Cache you could use as a good&nbsp;start.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, all is about checking the free resources, and decide if the <span class="caps">OS</span> swap is worth using or will cause more problems than&nbsp;help.</p>
<h3 id="tuning-the-value-and-other-helpful-changes">Tuning the value and other helpful changes.<a class="headerlink" href="#tuning-the-value-and-other-helpful-changes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are some reason you want to adjust the value. The basic one is changing your computer usage pattern, or changing hardware. That could mean you assumptions about how you use your computer, or the speed of it, are not longer valid. That would require a reevaluation of the previous steps, which can drive you to a similar value or a completly new&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>Other reason to change the value is because you detect it goes too slowly inside <span class="caps">GIMP</span> but changing to other applications is fast, which probably means tile size is too low. Or maybe you get complaints from other applications about not having enough memory, so probably better lower tile size if it is not already really&nbsp;small.</p>
<p>If you decided to use only <span class="caps">RAM</span> and it goes slow, you could try increasing the value a bit, but never to use also all the free swap. If the case is the contrary, using both <span class="caps">RAM</span> and swap, and you have problems about lack of resources, decrease&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>More tricks are to put the Swap Dir in a very fast disk, or in a different disk than the rest of things. Spreading the operating system swap over multiple disks is also a good way to speed up things, in general. And of course, maybe you have to buy more <span class="caps">RAM</span> or stop using lots of programs at the same time, you can not expect to edit a poster in a computer with <span class="caps">16MB</span> and be&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>On a side note: you can make your title or status bar show the memory usage (if not already doing so). That is the simplest way to keep an eye on how much memory you are using per image, and thus see what is the typical usage you get or if a image is just an exception and not worth the hassle of changing&nbsp;values.</p>
<h3 id="some-info-about-gimp-memory-usage">Some info about <span class="caps">GIMP</span> memory usage.<a class="headerlink" href="#some-info-about-gimp-memory-usage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You can check what memory requirements your images have in advance. The bigger the images and the number of undos, the more resources you need. This is another way to choose a number, but it is only good if you always work in the same kind of images, and thus the real requirements do not vary. It is also good to know if you will require more <span class="caps">RAM</span> and/or disk space so you can go shopping for hardware with a better idea of what you need (lots of <span class="caps">RAM</span> vs not so much <span class="caps">RAM</span> and better get a faster <span class="caps">CPU</span>, for&nbsp;example).</p>
<p>First is the memory for the pixel data. Each layer requires layer width * layer height * 3 bytes for <span class="caps">RGB</span> background without alpha or * 4 for <span class="caps">RGB</span> layers with&nbsp;alpha.</p>
<p>Then <span class="caps">GIMP</span> needs to store the selection mask, which is a width * height of the total image. Next, the composed image, which is what you see in your screen, requires image width * height * 5,33. The fractional part is because, starting with <span class="caps">GIMP</span> 2.4, the composed image is kept in several sizes. You can combine these two values as image width * height *&nbsp;6,33.</p>
<p>Last, there is some overhead <span class="caps">GIMP</span> needs to know where pixels are stored, so round the number up or add a 5-10% to be in safe side. For medium and big images, what really counts is the pixel related&nbsp;memory.</p>
